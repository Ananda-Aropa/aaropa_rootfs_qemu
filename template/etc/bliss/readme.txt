Welcome to the new BlissOS installation environment! This environment is built on a minimal Devuan ceres setup and includes several essential programs:

- GParted – Partition manager
- GPicView – Photo viewer
- GSmartControl – Hard drive health monitoring tool
- Htop – Process viewer
- L3afpad – Text editor
- PCManFM – File manager
- QTerminal – Terminal emulator
- JWM – Window manager

The installation process is powered by the Calamares installer. Before you begin, we recommend reviewing the tutorial in our documentation at https://docs.blissos.org.

With appreciation,
